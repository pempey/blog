<h1 id="fundamental-friday-5">Fundamental Friday #5</h1>
<h2 id="the-question">The Question</h2>
<p>This week I tasked myself with making a Big Number chart that answers the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the total value of D for this month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-design">The Design</h2>
<p>I once again stare with a sketch on paper.  I did another Big Number recently so that general design was still stuck in my head, <a href="https://vizfizz.blogspot.com/2021/01/fundamental-friday-3-call-out-with-big.html">Fundamental Friday #3 | Call out with a Big Number </a> so I wanted to focus on the use of color this week.  In this context, most of the sketch was dedicated to deciding how and where to apply color.</p>
<p><img src="file:///c:\GH\blog\assets\ff5_design_1.jpg" alt="A page of paper with hand written text"></p>
<p>So why use color in something as simple as a Big Number?  There is only one “category” so using color to encode those differences are not really needed.  Color can be used for style but that does not really feel fundamental to work on right now.  So that leaves me with using color to draw the attention of the viewer.  In the end I decided to use color in my background to visually separate the chart area from the page around it and use color to draw attention to imported numbers within the description.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>Having recently drawn a Big Number by hand, a rather meticulous process,  I decided to use Tableau to create my chart this week.  I will keep doing hand drawn charts, but when dread is my first feeling when I read the prompts this week I knew I needed to change things up.</p>
<p>Using the raw daily data that I set up I did have to spend some time creating new calculator fields to get at the numbers that I wanted.  I also had to use table calculations and filtering to get the previous months values into the description the way I wanted to, but  I won't go into those details in this post however. (If you would like to know how I did that feel free to reach out and ask)</p>
<p>I decided to go with a blue and orange color palette for this chart and I spent a bit of time picking colors and seeing how they looked together.  Color theory will tell you the blues and oranges are complementary but there is still an aesthetic choice as well as on screen and in print considerations.  It turns out I picked an ok contrast for an on screen presentation but when I pretended it was not so good. (never mind that my printer is terrible) :(</p>
<p><img src="file:///c:\GH\blog\assets\ff5_process.jpg" alt="A close up of a printed page"></p>
<p>I also bolded some of the other important numbers in the description as another “tier” of attention grabbing <code>(size -&gt;color -&gt; bold)</code>.  It may be a little thing, but I find that is useful.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>
<p>I was reminded this week that color on the screen is not the same thing as color on the page.  And that picking good colors does take work.  I would like to improve my skill at picking colors and not just go from instinct.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope that you were able to learn something from my process.</p>
