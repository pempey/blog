<h2 id="the-question">The Question</h2>
<p>This week I tasked my self to make a Line Chart that answered the following question‚Äù</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How have the values of D changed last month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-design">The Design</h2>
<p>I started with a sketch of the line chart.  Looking at the data I knew that there was not a lot of variation in the data and I wanted to highlight that.  I knew I wanted category D to be the only category represented and I wanted the vertical axis to start at zero to show the absolute scale.  The absolute scale would help highlight the lack of variation.</p>
<p>I also wanted to keep the date axis minimal.  I knew that not every day had a value and that the frequency of occurrence was not really helping answer the question. The vertical axis would have some graduations, again to help show the scale. Speaking of the vertical axis, I really don't like retaining text to be written vertically.  I see it <em><strong>ALL THE TIME</strong></em> in line charts and it hurts every time I see it.  But it saves space you say? Yeah I guess, but I decided to label the vertical axis and <em><strong>STILL</strong></em> save space, at least that was the plan.</p>
<p><img src="file:///c:\GH\blog\assets\ff4_design_1.jpg" alt="A page of paper with hand written text and drawn images"></p>
<p>I scratched out a few trial titles and decided on the proportions of the chart.  Sometimes a 1:1 ration looks good and sometimes a 2:3 ratio, longer side along the horizontal, looks better.  I knew it was already going to have little vertical movement in the chart so stretching it horizontally felt like just filling space with helping communicate the information. So a 1:1 ratio it is.</p>
<p>I also wanted to play around with different ways to indicate where on the lines the values were.  I felt that would help the view make more sense of the line as it was going to be sparse and little variance.  I also decided that this chart would be black and white.  Color was not going to add much if anything to this design.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>Once again I went for a paper implementation of the design.  It has been fun drawing them out by hand.  It makes me pay more attention to things like margin and padding. My handwriting still needs work, but it is not going to get better if I don't practice.</p>
<p>Lots of ruler use in this one to measure out the axis and to get straight lines.  I am glad that pencil is erasable because it can get very messy drawing out all of the reference lines.  Even though I was only going to show the first and last day on the horizontal axis I still need to measure out the days for plotting the data.</p>
<p><img src="file:///c:\GH\blog\assets\ff4_process.jpg" alt="A hand drawn grid of line"></p>
<p>Then it was just going over all of the lines with a pen.  I went with open circles to mark the data, it added just enough visual flair to catch the eye without distracting the viewer. And then lots of erasing and I was done.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>
<p>Still working on the handwriting, but it is not as distracting as it was when I started.  I also learned that color is not always needed and that sometimes less lines are better, you know less it more kind of thing.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you were able to learn something.</p>
