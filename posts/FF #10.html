<h2 id="the-question">The Question</h2>
<p>This week I tasked myself with making a Big Number chart that answers the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the year over year change in B for last year?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-design">The Design</h2>
<p>I went back to doing the design upfront and on paper.  I am planning on doing a mix of upfront and discovery design in upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>I started out my design by deciding if the chart would be exploratory or explanatory.  I settled on explanatory because there is not a lot of exploring that one can do when there is a single number on the chart.</p>
<p>Then I sketched out a few different styles of the presentation. I selected a number with supportive text and added a title this time.  I added the title for variety, I have made several other Big Number charts so far and I want to be sure I do not just get stuck in the same design.</p>
<p>After that I drafted the title and supportive text.  Because I was going to show a percent change I want to include the numbers for additional context.  And because I was going with and exploratory chart I wanted the title to give the meaning of the number.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>This week I decided to do my chart in Excel, of course my first excel chart in this series would be the least chart like.  I started by aggregating the numbers and determining the percent difference.</p>
<p>I added formatting to the number to show the ‘+’ symbol when the number was positive and ‘-’ when the number was negative.  I knew the number was not going to change but building these kind of features into my designs is a habit I have picked from working in environments where I would have to revisit and update my charts regularly.</p>
<p><img src="file:///c:\Hailstorm\blog\assets\ff10_process_1.jpg" alt="A screen shot of Excel cells with numbers and text"></p>
<p>In that same vein I designed the supportive text to link directly to the commuted cells.  Again I am not expected the numbers to charge, just feels like a good practice to maintain.  Then I started drawing out my shapes and text boxes because there is not a chart type for just a number in Excel.</p>
<p><img src="file:///c:\Hailstorm\blog\assets\ff10_process_2.jpg" alt="A screen shot of a blue square with white squares on top of it"></p>
<p>Then I added my computed formulas into the text boxes, again with the habits that make the next time easier,  and began forming the text.  I made the number itself the largest so it was on the top of the visual hierarchy.  I put the supportive text on the bottom of the hierarchy and the title in between them.  I also chose to bold a few important elements in the title so the view could read them.  Finally I played with font colors, in part to support the hierarchy and general esthetics.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>
<p>I learned that having the design before I start making the chart helps me.  Coming from last week when I started with no design to this week I could really notice it.  I am also noticing the visual hierarchy more and making conscious decisions about it and I think that is good.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and I hope you were able to learn something along with me.</p>
