<h2 id="the-question">The Question</h2>
<p>This week I tasked myself with making a Bar chart that answers the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What were the values of all categories for last month</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-design">The Design</h2>
<p>Back to simple this week as I was sick and had a bunk of other things happening as well.  But I still made myself start with a paper design before getting started.  I sketched out what I wanted it to look like, made some notes on the design and wrote out a title.  I also went with an exploratory chart as they are still the most natural to me.</p>
<p>I went with horizontal bars because I thought the difference between the min and max was going to be great and I think that is easier to read in a horizontal bar.  I added grid lines and axis values for better reference and added numbers to the bars, in the middle of the visual hierarchy, for precision comparison.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>Simple and straightforward with a bar chart in Tableau this week.  I did play with the font sizes and colors to get everything in a good place in the visual hierarchy, but everything else is native Tableau.  I put the chart on a dashboard so I had better control of the title and footer and that was it.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>
<p>This week I learned that designs can go fast and still be ok.  Too often I languish over designs, too much of a perfectionist sometimes, but that does not mean that I am always making them better.  Finding that good enough spot will take some time but I think I am making progress.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope that you learned something.</p>
