<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>
<p>I really want to be better at making and designing data visualizations.  And I want others to be good at it too.  So, to help me I am going to attempt to, every week, design a data visualization and then walk through the steps I took to create it.  My hope is that by practicing regularly and writing out my steps I will become better and that others will be able to learn along with me. Everybody wins.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-set">The Data Set</h2>
<p>The first thing I did was create a data set.  Given that I was going to do this every week, and I only wanted to focus on the designs, I did not what to spend time learning a new dataset every week.  So my data is randomly generated and changes every week.  That way I do not have to relearn the data but I am not making the exact same chart repeatedly.</p>
<p><img src="file:///c:\GH\blog\assets\sample_data.jpg" alt="A table of numbers with three columns"> <img src="file:///c:\GH\blog\assets\line_chart_sample_data.jpg" alt="A line chart with seasonal paters showing a years span of time"></p>
<h2 id="chart-types">Chart Types</h2>
<p>I am also limiting my chart types.  I do not want to get hung up on creating a specific design so I am limiting myself to five chart types that I see people making all the time: Bar Chart, Line Chat Pie Chart, Tables, Big Numbers.  I want to be very good at these fundamental ways to display data so I am going to make them over and over again.  And to pair with each chart type I created a randomly generated question, again for some variety but consistency.</p>
<p>With the preamble out of the way, so beings my #FundamentalFriday journey.</p>
<h1 id="fundamental-friday-1">Fundamental Friday #1</h1>
<h2 id="the-question">The Question</h2>
<p>This weeks task is to design a pie chart that answers the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does the value of B compare to All Categories for the Last Month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-design">The Design</h2>
<p>In anticipation of working on these types of questions I prepared the dataset to pre-aggregate the data in a way that I could get to what I needed for this kind of chart quickly, independent of the medium I choose to use to design the chart.  So for this week I choose to design the visualization by hand. Nothing like starting out on hard mode right? And my training as an engineer included drafting so I had all of the fancy tools to make nice circles. :grin:</p>
<p>For a pie chart I was only going to have two wedges, one for the category in question and one for the rest of the total.  The smallest wedge will start from the top of the circle (12 o’clock) and fill in a clockwise direction.  I would label each wedge with the category as well as the percent value, that way the pie shape is reinforcing the numbers that are being read and hopefully improve retention of the intended focus.  I also decided I would have just two colors, one for each wedge, on the chart.  I picked the colors to make the category in question stand out and draw the eye of the viewer.  To finish it off I also would include a simple title describing what the chart showed, providing the necessary context for the viewer.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>So after <em>&quot;loading in&quot;</em> my data, just two numbers total and the value of B, I had to do a little math for the pie chart because I needed the values as percentages. This was done by dividing the B value my the total value and multiplying by 100.</p>
<p>Then came the fun part: remembering my trigonometry so I could draw the wedge the correct size. :smile: The first thing to do was to convert my percent to degrees of a circle.  I did this by dividing by 100 to get the percent back to a decimal and then multiplying by 360 to find the number of degrees that my wedge would take up.  Now for that trigonometry.  I needed trigonometry because I don’t have a small enough protractor to directly draw the correct angle.</p>
<p>I drew a reference circle so I could get all of my parts and it turned out I needed to subtract 90 degrees from my angle and use the tangent function with the radius of my circle to draw a line that will intersect my circle at the connect place. Wheew, math is so much fun to write out isn’t it? :grimacing:</p>

<p><img src="file:///c:\GH\blog\assets\FF1_trig.jpg" alt="Hand written trigonometric equations"></p>
<p>Then came the final visualization.  I drew out my circle and added the wedge. I added the labels before I colored the wedges because I was not sure how well the pencil and pen would work with the colored pencils I was using.  I added my title and then went over all of my line with a pen.  I think I need a different/better pen because my line started smearing when I erased the pencil marks.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>
<p>This week I learned the typography is hard and I am glad there are computers to help with.  I feel like the messiness of my title distracts from the overall visualization. I think I will get some letter sentences to help with words in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming along this journey with me.</p>
<p>If you learned something share it with others.</p>
