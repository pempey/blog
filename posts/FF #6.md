## The Question

This week I tasked myself with making a bar chart that answers the following question:
 
> What are the values of all categories year to date?

## The Design

Starting with a piece of paper I sketched out two basic bar charts: a horizontal bar chart and a vertical bar chart. I have seen others refer to these are bar and column charts respectively, but for me they are the same.  Almost all of the same rules apply to both so it is easier for me to call them the same thing.  I thought through where I wanted to put the category and number labels.  I knew I did not want to use a legend, I generally try to avoid using them mostly because it is just a small chart that I have to make sure stays associated with the larger chart and it makes the visual layout more challenging. 

I also asked myself about sorting the bars, using colors, and adding context to the chart. I decided that I would use category sorting (more on that latter), to not use color encoding, and to not add additional context.  A lot of this was because I wanted to make a more exploratory style of chart where the viewer has the information they need to discover their own questions.  This exploratory style also leads to a simpler chart title, something that is purely descriptive and not leading the viewer to any particular conclusion.

## The Process

I went with Tableau as the tool to make my chart this week, in part because it is faster, and in part because I feel like I have not been using much lately and I wanted another excuse to use it.

I decided on making a vertical bar chart so I picked a rectangular chart size to allow the columns to have good spacing and to be wide.  I started with the category labels and the value labels to be above the chart, but I felt like the readability was not very good.  So I put the category labels under the bars and sorted them alphabetically.  Because I was not sorting the bars themselves, sorting the category labels improved the readability.  

I also added some grid lines to aid the reader in relative comparisons and to make the scale obvious.  This was not strictly necessary but when I do not know my audience, again the exploratory style, I want to make sure it is clear I have not miss-represented the data by only using part of the vertical axis.  

I also set the font sizes and colors for each element in a kind of importance hierarchy, Category Labels -> Value Labels -> Title -> Vertical Axis.  This is to provide some support to the viewer to the relative importance of the information without guiding them to an answer specifically.

## What I Learned

This week was really about layout.  The category sorted vertical bar chart needs the right amount of room to breath and the chart width and bar width and bar spacing all play together in this breathing room.  I also learned that horizontal axis labels are not bad and that they can support the viewer without being distracting.

Thanks for reading and I hope you were able to learn something today.
